# Coalition
Simulates forming a coalition, handling memory in C++

_____
Description: As part of my academic program, I had the opportunity to work on a project that required the implementation of a software that simulates the formation of coalitions in an election system. I leveraged my skills in the C++ programming language and my knowledge of memory management to develop this project. The outcome of this project was a comprehensive and efficient software that accurately mimics the coalition formation process in an election system.
